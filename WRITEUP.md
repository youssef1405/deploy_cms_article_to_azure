# Write-up Template

## Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

### I chose Azure App service over Azure VM for the following reasons

- App Service is typically cheaper for web applications, as it eliminates infrastructure management overhead. VMs, on the other hand, require additional costs for maintenance and scaling
- In case the app grows in trafic in the future, azure app service is better choise when it comes to dynamic scalling.
- Both Azure app services and VMs have high avalibaility features but app services reduces the complexity.
- Azure app services simplifies the development and workflows with the built-in tools 


### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

- If the application requires custom environments or full control over infrastructure. 
- If I need full OS-level control, custom software installations, or specific network configurations
